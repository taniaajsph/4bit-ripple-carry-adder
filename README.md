Verilog implementation of a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder with testbench verification
4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (Verilog)

This project implements a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) in Verilog. The design adds two 4-bit binary numbers and produces a 4-bit sum along with a carry-out. The RCA is constructed by connecting four 1-bit full adders in series, where the carry output of each stage is propagated to the next stage.
